# This bee script increments 4th column value if it is a NUMBER
# @t checks the type; Possibly just NUMBER could be used (@t is implicit)
# 
# No args

@i == 4 && @t == NUMBER ? $ + 42;

# Result:
# Pass Words
#   NOP
#   NOP
#   NOP
#   Pass NUMBER Expression
#     ADD $0, $0, 42
#     RETURN NOP
#   Pass DERIVED Expression
#     RETURN NOP

# Alternatives:
# @i == 4 && NUMBER ? $ + 42;
